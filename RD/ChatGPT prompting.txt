we want to develop a social media application,
it's based on "polls",
people are going to see different polls in their "timeline",
they can do multiple actions on each poll, like "like a poll", "comment on a poll", "share a poll with other users", and "contribute on a poll by choosing one or more than one poll options".
I want to create a "recommender system" to suggest polls to each user based on their preferences and interests,
in such a way that for example if a user has more interactions with "political" polls, he/she would be suggested polls that are related to "political" polls.

first, generate a "CSV" code block containing synthetic  "polls",
1. this dataset should contain these attributes: "poll_ID, author_ID, title, options, topics"
2.  the topics are the following list [Tech, Sport, Politics, Science, Activity, Art, Beauty, Economy, Fashion, Food&Drinks, Fun, Health, Music, Pets, Travel, Movies & TV shows, Home Décor], generate 10 exclusive instances for every 17 topics in separate code blocks
.

create it in the following format:
13,23,[string of a polls title],[option1,option2noption3,...],[topic1,topic2,...]
an example:
13,23,is there democracy in Iran?,[yes, no, to some level],[politics, government]create it in the following format:
13,23,[string of a polls title],[option1,option2noption3,...],[topic1,topic2,...]
an example:
13,23,is there democracy in Iran?,[yes, no, to some level],[politics, government]
the 'title' parts should be detailed, human-like, and with a more everyday natural tone and specific and not general.



I will describe a data frame format that is for storing posts with structures like "polls". in the following:
1. this dataset should contain these attributes: "poll_ID, author_ID, title, options, topics"
"poll_ID": exclusive id for each poll.
"author_ID": exclusive id of a poll's author.
"title": detailed, human-like, with an everyday natural tone, specific and not general caption for a poll, commonly in the form of a question or a caption.
2.  the topics are the following list [Tech, Sport, Politics, Science, Activity, Art, Beauty, Economy, Fashion, Food&Drinks, Fun, Health, Music, Pets, Travel, Movies & TV shows, Home Décor], generate 10 exclusive instances for every 17 topics in separate code blocks
.

create it in the following format:
13,23,[string of a polls title],[option1,option2noption3,...],[topic1,topic2,...]
an example:
13,23,is there democracy in Iran?,[yes, no, to some level],[politics, government]create it in the following format:
